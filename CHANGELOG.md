### Added
- Email unsubscribe links (CAN-SPAM / GDPR): every notification email now includes a per-recipient unsubscribe link and `List-Unsubscribe` header, a public `/unsubscribe` endpoint to opt out, and `EMAIL_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to configure the link's base URL. Opted-out recipients are skipped on subsequent sends.
- Email notification feature for event alerts with batching (one email per minute maximum)
- Email configuration via `EMAIL_SMTP_HOST`, `EMAIL_SMTP_PORT`, `EMAIL_SMTP_USER`, `EMAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD`, `EMAIL_FROM`, `EMAIL_TO`, and `EMAIL_CONTRACT_FILTER` environment variables
- Email notifications can be filtered by contract ID using `EMAIL_CONTRACT_FILTER`
- Prometheus metric `soroban_pulse_email_failures_total` for monitoring email delivery failures
- Documentation for email notifications in `docs/email-notifications.md`
- Contract ID format validation for SSE stream endpoint (`/v1/events/stream`)
- Database pool metrics to Prometheus endpoint (`soroban_pulse_db_pool_size`, `soroban_pulse_db_pool_idle`, `soroban_pulse_db_pool_max`)
- Separate CI job for integration tests with real PostgreSQL
- CHANGELOG.md and release process documentation
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming with keep-alive pings and automatic reconnection support
- OpenTelemetry distributed tracing support (optional `otel` feature)
